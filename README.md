Exploring the automation of some of Instagram's features through my dog's account.

### API
I'm using this incredible unofficial API deveioped in python by LevPasha:

### Backgorund Story
This is a -just-for-fun project. 
I made an IG account for my dog recently (cutest dude btw, go follow him: https://www.instagram.com/zorro_dogg/) and a friend in marketing who told me I could pay something around R$15 for a program that would start following a bunch of people related to the profile. Well, that sounded like something I could do myself, so I decided to give it a try :)
